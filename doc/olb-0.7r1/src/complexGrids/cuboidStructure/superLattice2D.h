/** The communication between the block lattices is done by two
 * communicators. One (_commStream) is responible to provide the data for
 * the streaming the other (_commBC) for the non-local boundary conditions.
 * To simplify the code structure ghost cells in an overlap of size
 * (_overlap) is indrocuced. It depends on the non-locality of the
 * boundary conditions but is at least one because of the streaming
 *
 * The algorithm is parallelized with mpi. The load balancer (_load)
 * distributes the block lattices to processes.
 *
 * WARNING: For unstructured grids there is an iterpolation needed
 * for the method buffer_outData in coboidNeighbourhood which is not
 * yet implemented! Moreover this class needs to be chanced
 * that the number of times steps for the collision and streaming is
 * is dependent of the refinement level.
 *
 * This class is not intended to be derived from.
